## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This is a follow up project for the Varda Vault unlockable content project launch, the Vault was funded by humanguild.io. The light of Eãrendil is built to engage the blender.org 3D creative community in minting on the near Blockchain using the mintbase standard smart contract and the Varda Vault unlockable content service directly from the blender 3D editor interface.
### Overview

Please provide the following:

- A python addon for the open source blender UI to mint a 3D render and lock the source file as unlockable content.
- Blender files are db files full of reusable assets for people to reproduce the rendered art, by selling a render and locking the corresponding .blend file you share your creative solution along with the nft. The market for this solutions on gumroad is very spread and used around the world.
- This project is built to spread news about the mintbase minting platform and smart contracts AND the varda vault in a creative community that has been growing and thriving for almost two decades, a community of creators that is used to spread news through YouTube channels and Twitter accounts if they like an addon, 
people have built businesses on suggesting the right addon for blender (example https://blender-addons.org/)
- I've been active in this creative community since 2012 and would enjoy participating to one of their creative challenges to spread word of this new tool.

### Project Details

To develop the python addon we plan to use the [Serpens addon](https://blendermarket.com/products/serpens) for the blender scripting interface:
- [Importing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rPy4Gn2a-q89NF56scdsaJdBHfnIu7s8/view?usp=drivesdk) the [near python API](https://github.com/near/near-api-py) and trigger the standard [minting action on a mintbase contract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QtwZ_iCDoYQR1joiodVZRX_RCmnjg2x5/view?usp=drivesdk), the minting action would be fired after the rendering has finished and the user has logged in with a [simple button located in one of these standard positions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cEowRRnfi4PKBXf4L4or7RneG171D6T7/view?usp=drivesdk) on the blender interface, triggering a web login.
- To lock the source content on the Varda Vault we would implement a specific locking endpoint on the [varda vault API](https://github.com/jilt/Vault-API-Filecoin) and the data importing options ([1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sjVCX1BqLhvBf4ol52P_lt_cxrRL_WjD/view?usp=drivesdk) and [2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1haCCWKAEPzMxbU5MLmOLCyhgI_qLBzfq/view?usp=drivesdk)) of the Serpens graphical scripting interface.
- Mintbase basic core functions [reference](https://github.com/Mintbase/mb-sdk), the user has to create his own smart contract on mintbase or be an allowed contributor of an already existing one.
- We are willing to submit the final addon in the blender market (they have a quite long selection process to be allowed to sell), gumroad and Serpens stores along with minting a mintbase nft on the jiltverse store with the addon as unlockable content. The whole developing rpocess will be finished by the end on October, because I'm November the #nodevember twitter creative challenge starts for the blender community and we wish to use our addon to create content for the whole challenge/month and use it to spread word of this new tool within the blender community.
Price will be 1$ on the stores were free download is not allowed, and money earned will go to a newly created DAO to support artists thatint with our solution.
- The first intention behind the light of Eärendil project is to share knowledge and tools with an open source creative community, used to develop and study their own tools instead of relying on prebuilt solutions.
To get an idea of the real value of this community of "builders" we can look at the blender market data/statistics for their add-ons, [1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hll_tIDUEaX-n6fb-kmWu8gggzr1-o9R/view?usp=drivesdk), [2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15xHPSvMRmLs4p0lIm7vtCco1zWlSuzon/view?usp=drivesdk), [3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kihkHL-OWZ1S-nf755h2jjWO-BWySYVT/view?usp=drivesdk), [4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jxOXpVSA-W2wZdVLXsnA36bExSmVwkNP/view?usp=drivesdk),
- I think fighting to spread awareness about the mintbase interface within these peopleay help you build a reliable community with a focus on utility in the nft technology.
- The Light of Eärendil isn't an integration of the Varda Vault unlockable content service into the mintbase UI, but the dev part on the Varda API will allow any near nft interface to do so by simply calling the varda https endpoint.
  - To spread word about the Light of Eärendill 30 works of art will be created during the nodevember challenge, linking yo the mintbase nft with unlockable addon attached. The nodes to create the artworks will be integrated in the addon before applying for blender market publication (usually takes 4 months to get accepted)

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? Unlockable nft content/nft utility
- Who is your target audience? The whole blender creative community, using their #nodevember yearly creative challenge with more than 2.5 k impressions on the most shared tweets ([stats here](https://www.trackmyhashtag.com/preview/overview?_token=9MpQzXkcVgdhuujy9E8NyuePr8knDNCWE42y4bKc&req_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trackmyhashtag.com&report_type=home&search_keyword=%23nodevember))
- integration of mintbase smart contracts with [one of the most used 3D editing interface in the world](www.blender.org).
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? No, the blender community has tried to breach the Blockchain using texos but it didn't work...

### Team's experience

I just finished my very first [nft marketplace interface](https://nft.varda.vision) and custom nft smart contract with rust on near, I have experience with geometry nodes to [create art](https://paras.id/token/x.paras.near::51477/51477%3A1) for the nodevember challenge and with python as you can see from my TARDIS repository (last project a time machine for the Dropbox API)
Although the varda vault unlockable content project is using the mintbase API I never applied for mintbase grants before

## Development Status :open_book:
Not yet started

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

As per the links provided in the description
Milestone 1: Addon development
- timing: by november 1
- result: downloadable links on gumroad, Serpens marketplace and mintbase/varda-vault with the python addon and a video to explain how to use it with the mintbase interface.
- start of creative work on the challenge
 Milestone 2: adding creative assets and social media strategy
- timing by December 2
- result: one blend file each day that will be included as creative asset to the next version on the addon, enlisted on the blender market store.
- start of 15 days competition to win 5000$ while using the addon with the assets and minting on mintbase, and sharing the nft page on twitter.

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

## Future Plans

Please include here
The Varda project aims to collaborate on and create an a reliable investing and service point for high level art and nfts on the near ecosystem, the Varda vault is built on the graph in order for queries to be the main source of tokens to sustain the project, we are waiting for the graph to be available as a decentralized network for the near Blockchain in order to achieve that, meanwhile we keep building on a decentralized data model and to share tools with the near creative community.
