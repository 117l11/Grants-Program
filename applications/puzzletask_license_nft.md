## Project Overview


Please provide the following:

Puzzletask - Blockchain Client Certification
- Souldbound Token Certification
- A brief description of your project.
  - Puzzletask is a no-code platform for Food Safety and Traceability Management serving Hospitality and Food Retail Sectors towards supply chain optimization. We cater to suppliers, hotels, retailers, and end consumers to encourage interaction in a data exchange micro-economy that incentivizes the sharing of valuable data to optimize the supply chain. Our solution has two revenue streams, one based on a SaaS Module and the other based on a Data Monetizing module.
In orther to slowly bring Blockchain technology for such a traditional sector as Food retail and Hospitality, we are launching our Souldbound Token Certificate to highlight the customers that are getting into the digital transformation path. This certification approach, from customer certification to license management we can use it in many ways in our business model.

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
  - We are bringing a real life use case for Souldbound Tokens as a way to certify our customers.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  - We aim to highlight the customers that are buying our tool 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- [Mockups/designs of any UI components](https://www.figma.com/proto/LQa40vQvo3WsaHbvMzAXK1/Puzzletask-NFT-certification?node-id=3%3A12&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A12)
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality:
  - We propose to develop a javascript library based on MintbaseJS that will be used to mint and subsequently retrieve a Soulbound Token with a set of attributes for a connected wallet. This library will be used by the Puzzletask SaaS after client authentication and after wallet connection to mint a certificate with a set of relevant attributes. There will be a set of pages in Puzzletask SaaS certificate workflow that will use this library to assess NFT existence and for NFT data retrieval.
- An overview of the technology stack to be used:
  - Javascript;
  - React;
  - MintbaseJS;
  

  

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - NFT (Soulbound Tokens)
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - Dapp's Userbase 
- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - Digital Food Safety Systems Certification to promote the companies that are reducing their food waste and paper.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - There isn't a similar project on NEAR Protocol and even considering other ecosystems, there is a lack of tradicional business adoption and this could a great oportunity for Mintbase and Near to leverage their market positioning

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.
  
By implementing this project we open the possibility to allow hotels to start to receive payments using $NEAR. This first approach will be important to start to educate our customer base about blockchain. This fact is crucial to allow our migration for a business model based on a data monetization in a micro-economy that incentivizes the sharing of valuable data to optimize the supply chain.
