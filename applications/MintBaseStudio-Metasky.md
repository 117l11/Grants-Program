### Overview
MintBase Studio - One-Stop Solution for Creators to curate, engage, and monetize their NFTs and their community. Powered by Metasky, Mintbase Studio enables creators, brands, and projects to activate their community via gamification and utility-focused NFTs. Studio provides a seamless, easy dashboard-type management system to help creators during the pre-mint and the post-mint activations for their community with a focus on 3 core pillars - Curation, Engagement, and Monetization

#### Curate
* Recognize and curate your community across online social channels such as Twitter (X), Instagram, Whatsapp, and Discord
* Launch gamified bounties to check the current engagement level of the community and design the NFT drop based on the analytics of these bounty programs

#### Engage
* Launch digital membership passes as NFTs that have built-in trait rarity
* Enrich the NFTs with utilities based on their trait rarity
* Easily link utilities to your NFTs from the Metasky utility library
* Gamify the experience to claim these NFTs

#### Monetize
* Earn commission on the secondary market trading of NFTs
* Launch super exclusive NFTs for the top 1% of community members

### How does this benefit Mintbase and the broader NEAR ecosystem?
Mintbase is one of the only fully automated Minter + Marketplace on NEAR that helps you create and list NFTs on your own smart contract with a full developer suite to enable you to build your own stand-alone market and NFT systems. With the introduction of MintBase Studio for the creators, Mintbase would now also have a pre-mint and post-mint infrastructure & offering thus providing a complete package of suites that play an important role for creators and traditional use cases looking to tap into Near Ecosystem. With the introduction of Studio on the existing Mintbase Marketplace, 
a. Creators would have complete choice to launch custom use-case specific collections such as Free Drop / Lazy Mint / PFP / Utility NFTs creation at ease with Claim Conditions for the community - With no gas, One Click Claimable NFTs
b. Creators can gamify their community via Bounties and gamify the rewarding experience via Tokens, XPs
c. Partner with Multiple Brands and ecosystem partners to offer custom Utilities to certain NFT Holders & completely manage the process on-chain seamlessly
