### Overview
MintBase Studio - One-Stop Solution for Creators to curate, engage, and monetize their NFTs and their community. Powered by Metasky, Mintbase Studio enables creators, brands, and projects to activate their community via gamification and utility-focused NFTs. Studio provides a seamless, easy dashboard-type management system to help creators during the pre-mint and the post-mint activations for their community with a focus on 3 core pillars - Curation, Engagement, and Monetization

#### Curate
* Recognize and curate your community across online social channels such as Twitter (X), Instagram, Whatsapp, and Discord
* Launch gamified bounties to check the current engagement level of the community and design the NFT drop based on the analytics of these bounty programs

#### Engage
* Launch digital membership passes as NFTs that have built-in trait rarity
* Enrich the NFTs with utilities based on their trait rarity
* Easily link utilities to your NFTs from the Metasky utility library
* Gamify the experience to claim these NFTs
