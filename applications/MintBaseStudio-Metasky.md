## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
MintBase Studio - One-Stop Solution for Creators to curate, engage, and monetize their NFTs and their community. Powered by Metasky, Mintbase Studio enables creators, brands, and projects to activate their community via gamification and utility-focused NFTs. Studio provides a seamless, easy dashboard-type management system to help creators during the pre-mint and the post-mint activations for their community with a focus on 3 core pillars - Curation, Engagement, and Monetization

#### Curate
* Recognize and curate your community across online social channels such as Twitter (X), Instagram, Whatsapp, and Discord
* Launch gamified bounties to check the current engagement level of the community and design the NFT drop based on the analytics of these bounty programs

#### Engage
* Launch digital membership passes as NFTs that have built-in trait rarity
* Enrich the NFTs with utilities based on their trait rarity
* Easily link utilities to your NFTs from the Metasky utility library
* Gamify the experience to claim these NFTs

#### Monetize
* Earn commission on the secondary market trading of NFTs
* Launch super exclusive NFTs for the top 1% of community members

### How does this benefit Mintbase and the broader NEAR ecosystem?
Mintbase is one of the only fully automated Minter + Marketplace on NEAR that helps you create and list NFTs on your own smart contract with a full developer suite to enable you to build your own stand-alone market and NFT systems. With the introduction of MintBase Studio for the creators, Mintbase would now also have a pre-mint and post-mint infrastructure & offering thus providing a complete package of suites that play an important role for creators and traditional use cases that are looking to tap into Near Ecosystem. With the introduction of Studio on the existing Mintbase Marketplace, 
a. Creators would have complete choice to launch custom use-case specific collections such as Free Drop / Lazy Mint / PFP / Utility NFTs creation at ease with Claim Conditions for the community - With no gas, One Click Claimable NFTs
b. Creators can gamify their community via Bounties and gamify the rewarding experience via Tokens, XPs
c. Partner with Multiple Brands and ecosystem partners to offer custom Utilities to certain NFT Holders & completely manage the process on-chain seamlessly

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
